  <p>
    The Caesar's Trail in the Jerusalem Mountains, which crossed Highway 375, became dangerous with an increase in the volume of traffic in the
    Highway in recent years and was closed. Now it has been re-marked and opened to travelers in combination with the marking of
    new routes, including a circular one. Now that the vegetation is in full bloom, this is exactly the time to travel.</p>
